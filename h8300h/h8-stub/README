1 Introduction

This stub is for URIBO on AKIZUKI AE-H8/3069-LAN Board.
The original version of this is from TOPPERS project.
(http://www.toppers.jp/contrib/h8_stub_2003_0603.tar.gz)
(URIBO INSTALLED DIR)/h8300h/h8-stub/original-version/h8_stub_2003_0603.tar.gz)

2 The work area

The stub uses 0xffc020 - 0xffd01f at on-chip RAM.
So, NEVER access this area from any other programs.
You can change it with the .mem file.

3 Serial port

The stub uses SCI1 (CN4) serial port.
You can change SCI channel by "CH" macro.
Please add "-DCH=0" option to "CFLAGS" line at Makefile,
and the stub will use SCI0.

Serial setting: 38400bps 8bits no-parity 1-stop-bit
It is assumed that CPU clock is 20MHz.

4 Print to GDB console.

Please execute "trapa #1" opecode to output one character to GDB console.
Parameter: er0=0, er1=character code

5 GDB ctrl-C break

You can make pause in the program execution by ctrl-C on GDB console.
This function depends on SCI receive interrupt.

6 Start debugging

(e.g., at Linux terminal)

$ h8300-linux-elf-gdb foobar.elf

(gdb) set remotebaud 38400
(gdb) target remote /dev/ttyS0    /* USB-seirial cable: /dev/ttyUSB0 etc. */
(gdb) display/i $pc
(gdb) load
(gdb) cont

Note: GDB 5.2.1 experienced.

8 GDB patch

It is recommended to modify the GDB source before you build.

--- (GDB source dir)/gdb/config/h8300/tm-h8300.h ---

Line 62:
#define TARGET_INT_BIT  32

Line 155:
#define ARGLAST_REGNUM	1

9 Disable DRAM burst access

Ths stub initialize DRCRA register by 0x30,
So, burst-enable and RAS-down-mode are off.
This slow access setting is to avoid problem with OKI MSM5117805 EDO DRAM.

10 Interrupt vector code

The original version makes pesudo vector on RAM but it is slow.
This version will only jump to kernel interrupt entry.
Howerver, the vector code saves er0 and er1 register value to the stack
and sets IRQ number to er0.
The first word of on-chip RAM (0xffbf20 - 0xffbf23) is used to
point kernel interrupt entry, and it symbol is "VECT" at isr.S.

11 GCC

The experienced version is 3.4.3.
The original version of stub uses COFF mode, but this version uses ELF mode.

12 Trap vectors

trapa #0: Call GDB console
trapa #1: Print to GDB console (See section 4)
trapa #2: Jump to URIBO interrupt entry
trapa #3: GDB break trap (Break points)
